<p>Hi my name is Jacrys and I created this site as poart of a 1-day training in C#.  I modified it piecemeal over a day to make sure everything looked the way I wanted it to.</p>

<p>Click Github, then Issues and enter the user and repo you want to see and it will show you all of the issues for that repository. I have included some hidden pieces here and there, see if you can find them.</p>
